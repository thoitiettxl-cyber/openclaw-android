Because Android deserves a shell.

## Why?

An Android phone is a great environment for running an OpenClaw server:

- **Sufficient performance** — Even models from a few years ago have more than enough specs to run OpenClaw
- **Repurpose old phones** — Put that phone sitting in your drawer to good use. No need to buy a mini PC
- **Low power + built-in UPS** — Runs 24/7 on a fraction of the power a PC would consume, and the battery keeps it alive through power outages
- **No personal data at risk** — Install OpenClaw on a factory-reset phone with no accounts logged in, and there's zero personal data on the device. Dedicating a PC to this feels wasteful — a spare phone is perfect

## No Linux install required

The standard approach to running OpenClaw on Android requires installing proot-distro with Linux, adding 700MB-1GB of overhead. OpenClaw on Android eliminates this by patching compatibility issues directly, letting you run OpenClaw in pure Termux.

| | Standard (proot-distro) | This project |
|---|---|---|
| Storage overhead | 1-2GB (Linux + packages) | ~50MB |
| Setup time | 20-30 min | 3-10 min |
| Performance | Slower (proot layer) | Native speed |
| Setup steps | Install distro, configure Linux, install Node.js, fix paths... | Run one command |

## Requirements

- Android 7.0 or higher (Android 10+ recommended)
- ~500MB free storage
- Wi-Fi or mobile data connection

## Step-by-Step Setup (from a fresh phone)

1. [Enable Developer Options and Stay Awake](#step-1-enable-developer-options-and-stay-awake)
2. [Install Termux](#step-2-install-termux)
3. [Initial Termux Setup](#step-3-initial-termux-setup)
4. [Install OpenClaw](#step-4-install-openclaw) — one command
5. [Start OpenClaw Setup](#step-5-start-openclaw-setup)
6. [Start OpenClaw (Gateway)](#step-6-start-openclaw-gateway)
7. [Access the Dashboard from Your PC](#step-7-access-the-dashboard-from-your-pc)

### Step 1: Enable Developer Options and Stay Awake

OpenClaw runs as a server, so the screen turning off can cause Android to throttle or kill the process. Keeping the screen on while charging ensures stable operation.

**A. Enable Developer Options**

1. Go to **Settings** > **About phone** (or **Device information**)
2. Tap **Build number** 7 times
3. You'll see "Developer mode has been enabled"
4. Enter your lock screen password if prompted

> On some devices, Build number is under **Settings** > **About phone** > **Software information**.

**B. Stay Awake While Charging**

1. Go to **Settings** > **Developer options** (the menu you just enabled)
2. Turn on **Stay awake**
3. The screen will now stay on whenever the device is charging (USB or wireless)

> The screen will still turn off normally when unplugged. Keep the charger connected when running the server for extended periods.

**C. Set Charge Limit (Required)**

Keeping a phone plugged in 24/7 at 100% can cause battery swelling. Limiting the maximum charge to 80% greatly improves battery lifespan and safety.

- **Samsung**: **Settings** > **Battery** > **Battery Protection** → Select **Maximum 80%**
- **Google Pixel**: **Settings** > **Battery** > **Battery Protection** → ON

> Menu names vary by manufacturer. Search for "battery protection" or "charge limit" in your settings. If your device doesn't have this feature, consider managing the charger manually or using a smart plug.

### Step 2: Install Termux

> **Important**: The Play Store version of Termux is discontinued and will not work. You must install from F-Droid.

1. Open your phone's browser and go to [f-droid.org](https://f-droid.org)
2. Search for `Termux`, then tap **Download APK** to download and install
   - Allow "Install from unknown sources" when prompted

### Step 3: Initial Termux Setup

Open the Termux app and paste the following command to install curl (needed for the next step).

```bash
pkg update -y && pkg install -y curl
```

> You may be asked to choose a mirror on first run. Pick any — a geographically closer mirror will be faster.

**Disable Battery Optimization for Termux**

1. Go to Android **Settings** > **Battery** (or **Battery and device care**)
2. Open **Battery optimization** (or **App power management**)
3. Find **Termux** and set it to **Not optimized** (or **Unrestricted**)

> The exact menu path varies by manufacturer (Samsung, LG, etc.) and Android version. Search your settings for "battery optimization" to find it.

### Step 4: Install OpenClaw

> **Tip: Use SSH for easier typing**
> From this step on, you can type commands from your computer keyboard instead of the phone screen. See the [Termux SSH Setup Guide](docs/termux-ssh-guide.md) for details.

Paste the following command in Termux.

```bash
curl -sL myopenclawhub.com/install | bash && source ~/.bashrc
```

Everything is installed automatically with a single command. This takes 3–10 minutes depending on network speed and device. Wi-Fi is recommended.

Once complete, the OpenClaw version is displayed along with instructions to run `openclaw onboard`.

### Step 5: Start OpenClaw Setup

As instructed in the installation output, run:

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the initial setup.

### Step 6: Start OpenClaw (Gateway)

Once setup is complete, start the gateway:

> **Important**: Run `openclaw gateway` directly in the Termux app on your phone, not via SSH. If you run it over SSH, the gateway will stop when the SSH session disconnects.

The gateway occupies the terminal while running, so open a new tab for it. Tap the **hamburger icon (☰)** on the bottom menu bar, or swipe right from the left edge of the screen (above the bottom menu bar) to open the side menu. Then tap **NEW SESSION**.

<img src="docs/images/termux_menu.png" width="300" alt="Termux side menu">

In the new tab, run:

```bash
openclaw gateway
```

<img src="docs/images/termux_tab_1.png" width="300" alt="openclaw gateway running">

> To stop the gateway, press `Ctrl+C`. Do not use `Ctrl+Z` — it only suspends the process without terminating it.

### Step 7: Access the Dashboard from Your PC

To manage OpenClaw from your PC browser, you need to set up an SSH connection to your phone. See the [Termux SSH Setup Guide](docs/termux-ssh-guide.md) to configure SSH access first. Open another new tab on the phone for `sshd` (same method as Step 6).

Once SSH is ready, find your phone's IP address. Run the following in Termux and look for the `inet` address under `wlan0` (e.g. `192.168.0.100`).

```bash
ifconfig
```

Then open a new terminal on your PC and set up an SSH tunnel:

```bash
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 -p 8022 <phone-ip>
```

Then open in your PC browser: `http://localhost:18789/`

> Run `openclaw dashboard` on the phone to get the full URL with token.

## Managing Multiple Devices

If you run OpenClaw on multiple devices on the same network, use the <a href="https://myopenclawhub.com" target="_blank">Dashboard Connect</a> tool to manage them from your PC.

- Save connection settings (IP, token, ports) for each device with a nickname
- Generates the SSH tunnel command and dashboard URL automatically
- **Your data stays local** — Connection settings (IP, token, ports) are saved only in your browser's localStorage and are never sent to any server.

## Bonus: AI CLI Tools on Your Phone

The compatibility patches included in this project fix Termux's native build environment, enabling popular AI CLI tools to install and run:

| Tool | Install |
|------|---------|
| [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) (Anthropic) | `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (Google) | `npm i -g @google/gemini-cli` |
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (OpenAI) | `npm i -g @openai/codex` |

Install OpenClaw on Android first, then install any of these tools — the patches handle the rest.

  <img src="docs/images/run_codex.png" alt="Codex CLI on Termux" width="32%">
</p>

## Update

If you already have OpenClaw on Android installed and want to apply the latest patches and environment updates:

```bash
oaupdate && source ~/.bashrc
```

This single command updates both OpenClaw (`openclaw update`) and the Android compatibility patches from this project. Safe to run multiple times.

> If the `oaupdate` command is not available (older installations), run it with curl:
> ```bash
> curl -sL myopenclawhub.com/update | bash && source ~/.bashrc
> ```

## Uninstall

```bash
bash ~/.openclaw-android/uninstall.sh
```

This removes the OpenClaw package, patches, environment variables, and temp files. Your OpenClaw data (`~/.openclaw`) is optionally preserved.

## Troubleshooting

See the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) for detailed solutions.

## What It Does

The installer automatically resolves the differences between Termux and standard Linux. There's nothing you need to do manually — the single install command handles all 5 of these:

1. **Platform recognition** — Configures Android to be recognized as Linux
2. **Network error prevention** — Automatically works around network-related crashes on Android
3. **Path conversion** — Automatically converts standard Linux paths to Termux paths
4. **Temp folder setup** — Automatically configures an accessible temp folder for Android
5. **Service manager bypass** — Configures normal operation without systemd

## Performance

CLI commands like `openclaw status` may feel slower than on a PC. This is because each command needs to read many files, and the phone's storage is slower than a PC's, with Android's security processing adding overhead.

However, **once the gateway is running, there's no difference**. The process stays in memory so files don't need to be re-read, and AI responses are processed on external servers — the same speed as on a PC.

## Detailed Installation Flow

Running `bash install.sh` executes the following 7 steps in order.

### [1/7] Environment Check — `scripts/check-env.sh`

Validates that the current environment is suitable before starting installation.

- **Termux detection**: Checks for the `$PREFIX` environment variable. Exits immediately if not in Termux
- **Architecture check**: Runs `uname -m` to verify CPU architecture (aarch64 recommended, armv7l supported, x86_64 treated as emulator)
- **Disk space**: Ensures at least 500MB free on the `$PREFIX` partition. Errors if insufficient
- **Existing installation**: If `openclaw` command already exists, shows current version and notes this is a reinstall/upgrade
- **Node.js pre-check**: If Node.js is already installed, shows version and warns if below 22

### [2/7] Package Installation — `scripts/install-deps.sh`

Installs Termux packages required for building and running OpenClaw.

- Runs `pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y` to refresh and upgrade packages
- Installs the following packages:

| Package | Role | Why It's Needed |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| `nodejs-lts` | Node.js LTS runtime (>= 22) + npm package manager | OpenClaw is a Node.js application. Node.js and npm are required to install it via `npm install -g openclaw`. LTS is used because OpenClaw requires Node >= 22.12.0 |
| `git` | Distributed version control | Some npm packages have git dependencies. Sub-dependencies of OpenClaw may reference packages via git URLs. Also needed if installing this repo via `git clone` |
| `python` | Python interpreter | Used by `node-gyp` to run build scripts when compiling native C/C++ addons. Required when OpenClaw's dependency tree includes native modules (e.g., `better-sqlite3`, `bcrypt`) |
| `make` | Build automation tool | Executes Makefiles generated by `node-gyp` to compile native modules. Core part of the native build pipeline alongside `python` |
| `cmake` | Cross-platform build system | Some native modules use CMake-based builds instead of Makefiles. Cryptography-related libraries (`argon2`, etc.) often include CMakeLists.txt |
| `clang` | C/C++ compiler | Default C/C++ compiler in Termux. Used by `node-gyp` to compile C/C++ source of native modules. Termux uses Clang as standard instead of GCC |
| `binutils` | Binary utilities (ar, strip, etc.) | Provides `llvm-ar` for creating static archives during native module builds. The installer also creates an `ar → llvm-ar` symlink since many build systems expect a plain `ar` command |
| `tmux` | Terminal multiplexer | Allows running the OpenClaw server in a background session. In Termux, apps going to background may suspend processes, so running inside a tmux session keeps it stable |
| `ttyd` | Web terminal | Shares a terminal over the web. Used by [My OpenClaw Hub](https://myopenclawhub.com) to provide browser-based terminal access to the host |
| `pyyaml` (pip) | YAML parser for Python | Required for `.skill` packaging in OpenClaw. Installed via `pip install pyyaml` after the Termux packages |

- After installation, verifies Node.js >= 22 and npm presence. Exits on failure

### [3/7] Path Setup — `scripts/setup-paths.sh`

Creates the directory structure needed for Termux.

- `$PREFIX/tmp/openclaw` — OpenClaw temp directory (replaces `/tmp`)
- `$HOME/.openclaw-android/patches` — Patch file storage location
- `$HOME/.openclaw` — OpenClaw data directory
- Displays how standard Linux paths (`/bin/sh`, `/usr/bin/env`, `/tmp`) map to Termux's `$PREFIX` subdirectories

### [4/7] Environment Variables — `scripts/setup-env.sh`

Adds an environment variable block to `~/.bashrc`.

- Wraps the block with `# >>> OpenClaw on Android >>>` / `# <<< OpenClaw on Android <<<` markers for management
- If the block already exists, removes the old one and adds a fresh one (prevents duplicates)
- Environment variables set:
  - `TMPDIR=$PREFIX/tmp` — Use Termux temp directory instead of `/tmp`
  - `TMP`, `TEMP` — Same as `TMPDIR` (for compatibility with some tools)
  - `NODE_OPTIONS="-r .../bionic-compat.js"` — Auto-load Bionic compatibility patch for all Node processes
  - `CONTAINER=1` — Bypass systemd existence checks
  - `CFLAGS="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration"` — Prevent Clang from treating implicit function declarations as errors (needed for building native modules like `@discordjs/opus` that compile cleanly with GCC but fail under Clang's stricter defaults)
  - `CXXFLAGS="-include .../termux-compat.h"` — Force-include C/C++ compatibility shim for native module builds
  - `GYP_DEFINES="OS=linux ..."` — Override node-gyp OS detection for Android
  - `CPATH="...glib-2.0..."` — Provide glib header paths for sharp builds
- Creates an `ar → llvm-ar` symlink if missing (Termux provides `llvm-ar` but many build systems expect `ar`)

After running `setup-env.sh`, `install.sh` re-exports all environment variables in the current process. Since `setup-env.sh` runs as a subprocess, its exports don't propagate to the parent. This re-export ensures Step 5's `npm install` inherits the correct build environment (CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, GYP_DEFINES, etc.).

### [5/7] OpenClaw Installation & Patching — `npm install` + `patches/apply-patches.sh`

Installs OpenClaw globally and applies Termux compatibility patches.

1. Copies compatibility patches to `~/.openclaw-android/patches/`:
   - `bionic-compat.js` — Node.js runtime patches (needed during npm install)
   - `termux-compat.h` — C/C++ build compatibility (renameat2 syscall wrapper)
   - `spawn.h` → `$PREFIX/include/spawn.h` — POSIX spawn stub header (if missing)
2. Installs `update.sh` wrapper as `$PREFIX/bin/oaupdate` for convenient updating
3. Runs `npm install -g openclaw@latest`
4. `patches/apply-patches.sh` applies all patches:
   - Verifies `bionic-compat.js` final copy
   - Installs `systemctl` stub to `$PREFIX/bin/systemctl` — a minimal script that intercepts systemd service management calls (which would fail in Termux since there is no systemd)
   - Runs `patches/patch-paths.sh` — uses sed to replace hardcoded paths in installed OpenClaw JS files:
     - `"/tmp"` / `'/tmp'` → `"$PREFIX/tmp"` / `'$PREFIX/tmp'`
     - `"/bin/sh"` → `"$PREFIX/bin/sh"`
     - `"/bin/bash"` → `"$PREFIX/bin/bash"`
     - `"/usr/bin/env"` → `"$PREFIX/bin/env"`
   - Logs patch results to `~/.openclaw-android/patch.log`
5. `scripts/build-sharp.sh` builds the sharp native module for image processing (non-critical):
   - Installs `libvips` and `binutils` packages
   - Installs `node-gyp` globally
   - Sets `GYP_DEFINES` and `CPATH` for Android/Termux cross-compilation
   - Runs `npm rebuild sharp` inside the OpenClaw directory
   - If the build fails, prints a warning and continues — image processing won't work but the gateway runs normally

### [6/7] Installation Verification — `tests/verify-install.sh`

Checks 7 items to confirm installation completed successfully.

| Check Item | PASS Condition |
|------------|---------------|
| Node.js version | `node -v` >= 22 |
| npm | `npm` command exists |
| openclaw | `openclaw --version` succeeds |
| TMPDIR | Environment variable is set |
| NODE_OPTIONS | Environment variable is set |
| CONTAINER | Set to `1` |
| bionic-compat.js | File exists in `~/.openclaw-android/patches/` |
| Directories | `~/.openclaw-android`, `~/.openclaw`, `$PREFIX/tmp` exist |
| .bashrc | Contains environment variable block |

All items pass → PASSED. Any failure → FAILED with reinstall instructions.

### [7/7] OpenClaw Update

Runs `openclaw update` to ensure the latest version. On completion, displays the OpenClaw version and instructs the user to run `openclaw onboard` to start setup.

## Lightweight Updater Flow — `oaupdate` / `update.sh`

Running `oaupdate` (or `curl ... update.sh | bash`) downloads `update-core.sh` from GitHub and executes the following 6 steps. Unlike the full installer, it skips environment checks, path setup, and verification — focusing only on refreshing patches, environment variables, and the OpenClaw package.

### [1/6] Pre-flight Check

Validates the minimum conditions for updating.

- Checks `$PREFIX` exists (Termux environment)
- Checks `openclaw` command exists (must already be installed)
- Checks `curl` is available (needed to download files)
- Migrates old directory name if needed (`.openclaw-lite` → `.openclaw-android` — legacy compatibility)

### [2/6] Installing New Packages

Installs packages that may have been added since the user's initial installation.

- `ttyd` — Web terminal for browser-based access. Skipped if already installed
- `PyYAML` — YAML parser for `.skill` packaging. Skipped if already installed

Both are non-critical — failures print a warning but don't stop the update.

### [3/6] Downloading Latest Scripts

Downloads the latest patch files and scripts from GitHub.

| File | Purpose | On Failure |
|------|---------|------------|
| `setup-env.sh` | Refresh `.bashrc` environment block | **Exit** (required) |
| `bionic-compat.js` | Node.js runtime compatibility patch | Warning |
| `termux-compat.h` | C/C++ build compatibility header | Warning |
| `spawn.h` | POSIX spawn stub (skipped if exists) | Warning |
| `systemctl` | systemd stub for Termux | Warning |
| `update.sh` | Install/update `oaupdate` command | Warning |
| `build-sharp.sh` | sharp native module build script | Warning |

Only `setup-env.sh` is required — all other failures are non-critical.

### [4/6] Updating Environment Variables

Runs the downloaded `setup-env.sh` to refresh the `.bashrc` environment block with the latest variables. Then re-exports all variables in the current process so that Step 5's `npm install` inherits the correct build environment.

### [5/6] Updating OpenClaw Package

- Installs build dependencies: `libvips` (for sharp) and `binutils` (for native builds)
- Creates `ar → llvm-ar` symlink if missing
- Runs `npm install -g openclaw@latest` — environment variables from Step 4 are inherited, enabling native modules (sharp, `@discordjs/opus`, etc.) to build correctly
- On failure, prints a warning and continues

### [6/6] Building sharp (image processing)

Runs `build-sharp.sh` to ensure the sharp native module is built. If sharp was already compiled successfully during Step 5's `npm install`, this step detects it and skips the rebuild.
